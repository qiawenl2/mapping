			<p>
					You are about to play a game with another MTurk worker. Typically it will last around <strong>15 minutes</strong>.
					<br />
					<br />

					In this game, you'll be either a {"  "}
					<strong>guesser</strong> or a {"  "}
					<strong>thinker</strong>.
					<br />
					At the beginning of each round, the thinker will be prompted to give a common 
					concept (e.g., sun). 
					<br />
					After choosing a concept, the thinker should then enter the category 
					of that concept (e.g., celestial body)
					<br />
					The guesser will be told <strong>only the category</strong> of that concept and will then ask the thinker a
					question like "What would it be, if it were a X (e.g.,profession)?" (Please make sure X <strong>is not the same </strong>as what the thinker just gave.)
					<br />
					The thinker will then respond with a concept that <strong>does not directly
					describe characteristics of that concept </strong>(e.g. saying "it would be astronaut" to a "profession" category, if the concept is "sun"), but rather
					metaphorically describes it (e.g."it would be king")
					<br />
					At the end of each round, the guesser will try to guess the concept.  
					<br />
					You'll see a box in the middle of the screen with your Q & A record which look like this ("sun" is the concept to be guessed):
					 {/* <div className="task-stimulus"> */}
                 		 <img src="/instructions/instruction.jpg" className="task-image" width="900" height="400"/>
						{/* </div> */}
					<br />
					This is a collaborative game, so if the guesser gets it right, then both of you will win a bonus!
					{/* The guesser will be prompted to ask a series of <strong>"what would it be, if it were a XXX"</strong> questions.
					<br /> 
					<strong></strong>(e.g., "What would it be, if it were a city?")
					<br />
					The thinker should then give a city that best describes the concept.
					{/* At the beginning of each round, the thinker will be prompted to give a common 
					concept (e.g., New York, Jesus, etc.). After choosing a concept, the thinker should then enter the category 
					of that concept (e.g., city, person, etc.).
					The guesser will be told the category of that concept and will then ask the thinker a
					question like "what would it be, if it were a X(e.g.,profession)?" The thinker will then respond with a concept that does not directly
					describe characteristics of that concept (e.g. saying "President" to a "Profession" category if the concept is "Donald Trump."), but rather
					metaphorically describes it.
					At the end of each round, the guesser will try to guess the concept.   */}
